# Dog Adoption Project From Scratch
This project is a website dedicated to showcasing dogs available for adoption. All the dogs listed on the site are stray dogs that have been rescued and placed in public shelters. The main goal is to centralize information about all available dogs in one city, making it easier for people to find a dog for adoption.

## Features

Dog Search: Filters allow users to search for dogs by characteristics such as size, age, and shelter location.
Details Page: Each dog has a dedicated page with more information and pictures.
Register newly rescued dogs.
Edit dog information.
Manage completed adoptions.
Delete or archive animals that have already been adopted.

## Admin Panel

## Social Impact
This project aims to make a positive impact on the community by facilitating the adoption of stray dogs and helping to reduce the number of abandoned animals. By centralizing all adoption information for a city in one place, we hope to create a bridge between shelters and people willing to offer a new home to these animals.
